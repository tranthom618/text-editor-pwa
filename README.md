## Description

JATE or "Just Another Text Editor" is a text editor project designed specifically as progressive web application (PWA). JATE takes JavaScript files, bundles them into a webpack. When running the webpack plugins, it generates an HTML file, a manifest file, service workers, and a database storage called IndexedDB. These tools allows this text editor to do a number of things. It locally caches data, so any text is persisently saved, even if the browser or page is closed. It also allows the app to be locally installed on your machine. It additionally allows the app to function even when offline.
